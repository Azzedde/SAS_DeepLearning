# Detecting Hate Symbols on Images - Support Crime Investigations in Social Media

### Why:
Social media such as Facebook, WhatsApp and WeChat are wonderful ways to communicate with people all over the world.
Unfortunately these platforms are also used by criminals which is the reason why crime fighters want to investigate the contents on these platforms.

In Germany we have some symbols that are considered "unconstitutionally" and are forbidden by law. We call them hate symbols.<br>
One of these symbols is the swastika, a famous symbol among nazis or the flag of Nazi Germany. But we have these hate symbols all around the world. A prominent example is also the isis flag.<br>

Now, imagine being part of an investigation group of the police that is responsible to fight right-wing or terroristic organizations.<br>
You have scraped data from various channels, e.g. Twitter, Facebook, WeChat & Co. and now you're sitting on a huge pile of images not knowing where to start looking.<br>
Manually investigating these data sources is impossible, due to their size and variety.<br>

That's the reason why we try to incorporate computer vision technology to automatically detect hate symbols on images, allowing the investigation officers to focus on the relevant images and their sources.<br>
This not only saves manual effort but also enables officials to better protect the law.

### Data
This data was scraped by myself from Google Images - therefore it is a quite small dataset.<br>
But to give your further ideas what images might be of interest I'd like to point you to the following site:<br>
