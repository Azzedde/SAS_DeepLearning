# Real Time Object Detection
In this example I use our standard pretrained Tiny YOLO v2 model in SAS Event Stream Processing to do real time object detection using images from your webcam.
The model is also available on the SAS page. [Link](http://support.sas.com/documentation/prod-p/vdmml/zip/index.html).<br>
This demo comes in two flavours:<br>
1. Using the Jupyter Notebook to draw boxes on the images
2. Using the Python script in MAS to draw boxes on the images

## Usage ideas
* Demonstrate the object detection capabilities of modern YOLO models

## Requirements
Nothing special as we are using an astore-model.

## Further ideas
Drawing bounding boxes around objects won't impress that many people today. But using the predictions of this model can still create beautiful demos. Examples might be:<br>
* Counting persons on a street
* Counting cars on a highway
