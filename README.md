# Deep Learning with SAS (Unofficial Repository)

### About the Author
Welcome to my personal GitHub repository!<br>

I am Michael Gorkow, a German Data Scientist living in the beautiful city of Munich and working for SAS.<br>
My general focus area is advanced analytics but my passion really lies in applying state-of-the-art deep learning on complex problems.<br>
In the last couple of years I've been working a lot with deep learning and from time to time I create demonstrations how complex problems with unstructured data can be tackled.<br>

Even though I am working for SAS, I am more comfortable programming in Python. Fortunately this is possible by leveraging Open Source libraries provided by official SAS repositories.<br>

Additionally I also like to work with Open Source deep learning frameworks, e.g. TensorFlow. Fortunately again, we can incorporate models trained with Open Source libraries in SAS as well. 

### Private Repository
In this personal repository I'd like to share some of my deep learning works with SAS Software that I consider publicly shareable.<br>
It mainly uses SAS Viya for model building and scoring as well as SAS Event Stream Processing where I apply deep learning models on streaming data, e.g. videos.<br>

Please Note: This is my private repository and not an official SAS repository.<br>
If you are looking for official SAS repositories, please go to:

* [SAS Viya Deep Learning API for Python](https://github.com/sassoftware/python-dlpy)
